# 🚀 Nexus CLI

The Nexus CLI lets you run a **prover node** and contribute proofs to the Nexus network.
It is the **highest-performance** way to participate.

---

## 🪄 Quick Start

Run the installation script and start the CLI with your node ID:

```bash
curl https://cli.nexus.xyz/ | sh
nexus-network start --node-id <your-node-id>
```

You may register a user account and obtain a node ID at [app.nexus.xyz](https://app.nexus.xyz), or with:

```bash
nexus-network register-user --wallet-address <your-wallet-address>
nexus-network register-node
```

For troubleshooting or to see available command line options, run:

```bash
nexus-network --help start
```

Or, with Docker:

```bash
docker pull nexusxyz/nexus-cli:latest
docker run -it --init nexusxyz/nexus-cli:latest start --node-id <your-node-id>
```

Or, from source:

```
cd clients/cli
cargo run -r -- start --node-id <your-node-id>
```

You may obtain a Devnet node ID to connect to the Nexus network by following the instructions below:

1) Go to https://app.nexus.xyz/nodes,
2) Sign in,
3) Click on the '+ Add Node' button,
4) Select 'Add CLI node',
5) You will be given a node ID to add to this CLI

To clear credentials and log out of the CLI, run:

```bash
cargo run -r -- logout
```
